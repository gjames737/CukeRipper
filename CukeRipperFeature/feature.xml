      If you complain, this plug-in can hear you and it will shoot lasers at you and your brain will explode!  Originally it 
      used red lasers, but an update switched them to green lasers (because there more in line with the them of cucumbers).  
      So, by accepting this license, you do promise to give the developer(s) of CukeRipper all of your worldly possessions.
      
      First you must find... another shrubbery! Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here, 
      beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get a two layer effect with a little path running down the 
      middle.  Then, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!
